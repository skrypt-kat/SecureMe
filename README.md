This is a very...messy tool made by putting together scraps of code and using them to build on the original kybouw/SecureMe script, blended with some chunks i found in other scripts, as well as bits and pieces i created using chatGPT. This script is still very much under development and i advise you to use at your own risk and read through it to know exactly what each function does. Any criticism is welcome as this script is DEFINITELY far from perfect, but i'm proud of how far its come.

This script is mainly targeted at newer linux based operating systems, however it may work on other ones, i am yet to check this.

In the future i'm planning on separating the entire script into a collection of smaller scripts, as well as adding more options i.e more operating system specific as some files/commands may differ, and maybe creating a testing script to make sure everything that was supposed to be done was done.

# How to use this tool
Here is a quick guide for using this script

1. Either download the file or copy paste it into a new open file on your machine
2. You must make the main.sh file executable `$ sudo chmod +x main.sh`, or whatever you choose to call it, its up to you
3. You run the main.sh file like so... `$ sudo ./main.sh` (or whatever name you've chosen)
4. Follow the pompts along the way, it may take some time. Make sure to read through the script ahead of time to know what each function does

And that's all there is to it!
